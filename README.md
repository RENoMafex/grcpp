## About

[**grc** (Generic Colouriser)](https://github.com/garabik/grc) is a tool for adding color to command-line output. This project, **grcpp**, aims to provide a modern, efficient, and extensible implementation, while still being able to be a dropin replacement of the original tool using C++.

## Features

- Drop in replacement for **grc**
- Improved performance and maintainability with modern C++.
