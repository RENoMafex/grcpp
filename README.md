## 1. About

[**grc** (Generic Colouriser)](https://github.com/garabik/grc) is a tool for adding color to command-line output. This project, **grcpp**, aims to provide a modern, efficient, and extensible implementation, while still being able to be a drop-in replacement of the original tool using C++.

## 2. Changes

Grcpp aims to be faster than the original grc, that is why i decided to go for a single binary (opposed to grc wich uses another program called grcat to colorize the output) and utilize multithreading.

### 2.1 Details
#### Visual representation of how grc works
![flowchart of how grcpp works](.github/images/flowchartgrc.svg)

#### Conclusion
Now it should be pretty clear, that **grc** only is a wrapper for the underlying grcat (also part of the grc project) which can induce some performance overhead, so i decided to build this program into a single file, which simply utilizes threads to colorize the output(s).

### 2.2 Why?

My daily machine is a very old laptop where grc sometimes induces some noticable lag, i think for the most machines grc is just fine, but for me personally its to slow, thats why i decided to rebuild it in C++ in a performance optimized way.

## 3. How to contribute

- If you find any issue with the code, please just open an issue through GitHub. If you don't have a GitHub Account (and don't want to create one), just send an email to [schilling.malte@googlemail.com](mailto:schilling.malte@googlemail.com).
- If you want to contribute code to this repo, just open a Pull Request through GitHub.
>[!NOTE]
>Proper instructions for contributing to grcpp will be added later.

## 4. Features

- Drop-in replacement for **grc**.
- Improved performance and maintainability with modern C++.

## 5. Installation

A Makefile is included.
>[!NOTE]
>Proper instructions for building and installing grcpp will be added soon.

## 6. Usage

Usage examples and documentation will be provided as the project progresses.
When the project enters beta state, the usage will be the same as grc.

## 7. Acknowledgments

Special thanks to [Radovan Garab√≠k](https://github.com/garabik) for creating the original **grc** tool.
