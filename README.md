# grcpp

#### This repository is a C++ rewrite of the tool [**grc**](https://github.com/garabik/grc) by Radovan Garabik.

### <text color=red>**WARNING!** This software is NOT in a working state and should not be used. Please only use this code for educational or development purposes!</text>

## About

[**grc** (Generic Colouriser)](https://github.com/garabik/grc) is a tool for adding color to command-line output. This project, **grcpp**, aims to provide a modern, efficient, and extensible implementation, while still being able to be a dropin replacement of the original tool using C++.

## How to contribute

- If you find any issue with the code, please just open an issue through GitHub. If you don't have a GitHub Account (and don't want to create one), just send an email to [schilling.malte@googlemail.com](mailto:schilling.malte@googlemail.com).
- If you want to contribute code to this repo, just open a Pull Request through GitHub, 
>Proper instructions for contributing to grcpp will be added later.

## Features

- Drop in replacement for **grc**.
- Improved performance and maintainability with modern C++.

## Installation

Instructions for building and installing **grcpp** will be added soon.

## Usage

Usage examples and documentation will be provided as the project progresses.
When the project enters beta state, the usage will be the same as grc
